# Case Study: How can a wellness technology company play it smart?

## Project Overview
### Scenario:
Bellabeat, a wellness technology company, aims to leverage smart device fitness data to enhance its products and marketing strategies. As a junior data analyst, I analyzed Fitbit user activity and sleep data to uncover trends and provide actionable insights.

### Business Task:

1. Identify correlations between activity levels (calories burned, intensity) and sleep quality.

2. Determine behavioral patterns (e.g., trade-offs between exercise and rest).

3. Provide data-driven recommendations for product improvements and marketing strategies.

## Features
### Datasets Used:
1. daily_activity.csv (Steps, distance, active minutes, calories)
2. sleep_day.csv (Sleep duration, time in bed)

### Key Metrics Analyzed:
1. **Activity Levels:** Vigorous, moderate, light, sedentary

2. **Sleep Patterns:** Total minutes asleep, sleep efficiency

3. **Caloric Burn:** Efficiency across different activity intensities

4. **Weekly Trends:** Activity peaks and declines by day
